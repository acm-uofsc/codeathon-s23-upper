here is the chain after each step (with the left side touching the ceiling)

	1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
    9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 11 12
    5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 10 11 12
    10 11 12 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4

After the last move, the last 5 links are `9 1 2 3 4`, hence this is printed.







This is the first chain after each move (top line is initial configuration)


    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
    1 2 3 7 8 9 10 4 5 6
    1 2 7 8 9 10 3 4 5 6

    1 2 3 4 5 6 7
    7 1 2 3 4 5 6
    3 7 1 2 4 5 6
    3 1 2 4 5 7 6
