# Domino Disaster

## Problem Statement

You have just spent DAYS setting up the world's largest domino chain. Big Domino doesn't want you taking their record, so they stole key dominos from the chain so you wouldn't be able to fix it in time. 
You have to figure out where to put the dominos to make the longest chain (s)?

## Input Format

What does each line contain? What data type(s)?

## Constraints

What are the constraints on the number of lines, size of each parameter, etc.

## Output Format

What should the output look like? What data type(s)?

# Instructions for Problem Writers

Replace all filler with your own information. This is what will go in HackerRank.

Modify mkin.py to print the problem input to the console.

Run genSamples.sh to only generate the inputs for the sample cases. You may want special checks on test number if you want to generate a certain number of very large tests. 

Run runSampleInput.sh to generate sample outputs using your **correct** solution (solutions/sol.py). Make sure these are valid.

Run testgen.sh to generate the remaining test cases. Modify this if you need more/fewer test cases. The cases.zip file is what will be uploaded to HackerRank.
